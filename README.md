<p>Welcome to the Wave programming language documentation. The Wave project is currently in development. As of September 3, 2023, we are using Antlr for its development, though this may change in the future.</p>

<p>What exactly is the Wave programming language? Wave is a compiled language. It's a compiled language developed by someone named LunaStev for game development. It was created for game framework and game engine development, and our aim is to develop a language optimized for such functions.</p>

## Code

```wave
fun hello(name :str) {
  print("{}", name);
}

fun main() {
  var a = "LunaStev";
  count b = 10;
  print("Hello, World! {a} {b}");
  hello("LunaStev");
}
```

```cmd
Hello, World! LunaStev 10
LunaStev
```
